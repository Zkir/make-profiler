- Critical Path is highlighted;

- Inline pictures-targets into build overview;

- Logs for each target marked with timestamps;

- Distinguish a failed target execution from forgotten touch;

- Navigate to last run's logs from each target directly from call graph;

- Support for self-documented Makefiles according to
  http://marmelab.com/blog/2016/02/29/auto-documented-makefile.html

## Example usage

    sudo apt install python3-pip graphviz gawk
    sudo pip3 install https://github.com/konturio/make-profiler/archive/master.zip

    cd your_project
    profile_make -h                 # have a look at help

    profile_make                    # generate overview graph without profiling data
    xdg-open make.svg               # have a look at call graph

    profile_make_clean target_to_remove_with_children

    profile_make_lint               # validate Makefile to find orphan targets
    profile_make -j -k target_name  # run some target, record execution times and logs
    xdg-open make.svg               # have a look at call graph with timing data
